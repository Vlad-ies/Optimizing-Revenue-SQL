##  SQL part 
We employed our SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company. Our task involved working with numeric, string, and timestamp data, which encompassed pricing and revenue figures, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic statistics. <br>
Throughout the analysis process, we applied various techniques, including aggregation, data cleansing, labeling, working with Common Table Expressions, and establishing correlations. Our ultimate goal was to generate actionable recommendations that could empower the company to optimize its revenue potential. <br>
All our consistent steps:
1.Counting missing values
2.Nike vs Adidas pricing
3.Labeling price ranges
4.Average discount by brand
5.Correlation between revenue and reviews
